# Deviget - Wordpress Code Test 

### Development Steps
I'll be updating this readme.md with my steps and a timestamp each update (will push to the repo after each new update)

- 13:20 - project start. I've started by reading the project requirements and researching documentation for each item
- 13:47 - Wordpress local install, .gitignore and readme.md creation
- 14.12 - Created theme folder and barebones theme files: index.php, header.php, footer.php, style.css, screenshot.png and functions.php
